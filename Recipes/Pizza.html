        <p style="font-size: 250%;">Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 250%;">Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, 
            and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.
            In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. 
            Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. They are then cooked using a home oven.</p>
